# int24_t
C++ implementation of a 24-bit integer class.

## Usage
Simply include `int24_t.h` in you C++ project to utilize the int24_t type!
```cpp
#include "int24_t.h"
```

## Testing
`test.cpp` includes a bunch of tests (not guaranteed to be a complete test suite) that you can use to verify the accuracy of int24_t operations. Compile the test program in linux and run it like so:
```bash
g++ test.cpp -o test.a
./test.a
All tests passed!
```
